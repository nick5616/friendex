# Friendex Dex

Friendex is a Pokedex-style personal relationship manager designed to help you remember and strengthen your connections with friends, family, and partners. It acts as an external memory aid, allowing you to keep track of important information about the people in your life, all in one private, offline-first application.

The core philosophy is to convert passive knowledge into active connection by reducing the cognitive load of relationship maintenance.

## ‚ú® Core Features (Vision)

-   **Offline-First:** Runs entirely in your browser. All data is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB, ensuring complete privacy.
-   **Tactile Interface:** A "rolling index" UI inspired by the classic Rolodex and Pokedex, designed to be fun and engaging.
-   **Rich Profiles:** Store everything from contact info and social media handles to birthdays, interests, gift ideas, and personal notes.
-   **Easy Sharing:** Generate a QR code of your public profile to quickly and easily exchange information with new friends.
-   **Data Portability:** Export your entire friend database to a single JSON file for backup and import it on any device.
-   **Installable PWA:** Install Friendex to your phone's home screen for a native app-like experience.
